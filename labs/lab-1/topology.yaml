# Sample Containerlab Topology: simple-two-ceos.clab.yml
# This file defines a basic network topology using Arista cEOS nodes.

# Name of the lab deployment
name: simple-two-ceos

# Topology definition
topology:
  # Define the network nodes
  nodes:
    # Node 1: Arista cEOS container named 'ceos1'
    ceos1:
      kind: ceos            # Type of node (Arista cEOS)
      # IMPORTANT: Replace 'your-ceos-image:latest' with the actual cEOS image
      # you have built or imported (e.g., ceos:4.28.0F).
      # Containerlab does not bundle vendor images.
      image: your-ceos-image:latest

    # Node 2: Arista cEOS container named 'ceos2'
    ceos2:
      kind: ceos            # Type of node
      # IMPORTANT: Use the same cEOS image name as above.
      image: your-ceos-image:latest

  # Define the links between nodes
  links:
    # Connect ceos1's Ethernet1 interface to ceos2's Ethernet1 interface
    # Note: cEOS interface names typically start with Ethernet1
    - endpoints: ["ceos1:Ethernet1", "ceos2:Ethernet1"]

# --- How to use ---
# 1. Make sure you have a cEOS container image available in your Docker environment.
#    You might need to download it from Arista's website (requires account) and import it,
#    or build it if you have the necessary source files.
# 2. Update the 'image:' lines above with the correct name and tag of your cEOS image.
# 3. Save this content as 'simple-two-ceos.clab.yml' (or similar).
# 4. Run the topology using sudo:
#    sudo containerlab deploy -t simple-two-ceos.clab.yml
#
# To destroy the lab:
# sudo containerlab destroy -t simple-two-ceos.clab.yml --cleanup
